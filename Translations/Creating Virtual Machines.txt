Objectives
-->In this lab, you explore the available options for VMs and see the differences between locations.

-->In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

-->Create several standard VMs

-->Create advanced VMs



Task 1: Create a utility virtual machine

	In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu, click Compute Engine > VM instances.
	
	Click Create.

	For Name, type a name for your instance. Hover over the question mark icon for advice about what constitutes a properly formed name.

	For Region and Zone select us-central1 and us-central1-c respectively.

	For Machine type, examine the options.

	Click Details to the right of the Machine type list to see the breakdown of estimated costs.

	For Machine type, click n1-standard-4 (4 vCPUs, 15 GB memory). How did the cost change?

	For Machine type, click n1-standard-1 (1 vCPUs, 3.75 GB memory).

	Click Management, security, disks, networking, sole tenancy.

	Click Networking.

	For Network interfaces, click the Edit icon (Edit).

	Select None for External IP.

	Click Done.


## To Explore the VM logs

	On the VM instance details page for your VM, click Stackdriver Logging.

	Click the small triangle to the left of one of the lines to see the kind of information it contains.
	
	On the far right, click View Options > Expand All.



Task 2: Create a Windows virtual machine

	On the Navigation menu click Compute Engine > VM instances.
	
	Click Create instance, then specify the following...

	Name			Type a name for your VM
	Region			europe-west2
	Zone			europe-west2-a
	Machine type		n1-standard-2(2 vCPUs, 7.5 GB memory)
	Boot disk		Change
	Public Images > Operating system	Windows Server
	Version	Windows 	Server 2016 Datacenter Core
	Boot disk type		SSD persistent disk
	Size (GB)		100

	Click Select.
	
	For Firewall, enable Allow HTTP traffic and Allow HTTPS traffic.
	
	Click Create.


## To Set the password for the VM, do the following...

	Click on the name of your Windows VM to access the VM instance details.
	
	You don't have a valid password for this Windows VM: you cannot log in to the Windows VM without a password. Click Set Windows password.
	
	Click Set.
	
	Copy the provided password, and click CLOSE.



Task 3: Create a custom virtual machine

	On the Navigation menu, click Compute Engine > VM instances.
	
	Click Create instance and specify the following...


	Name		Type a name for your VM

	Region		us-west1

	Zone		us-west1-b

	Machine type	Custom

	Cores		6 vCPU

	Memory		32 GB

	Click Create.


## To Connect via SSH to your custom VM, do the following...

	For the custom VM you just created, click SSH.

	To see information about unused and used memory and swap space on your custom VM, run the following command:

		free


	To see details about the RAM installed on your VM, run the following command:

		sudo dmidecode -t 17


	To verify the number of processors, run the following command:

		nproc


	To see details about the CPUs installed on your VM, run the following command:

		lscpu


	To exit the SSH terminal, run the following command:

		exit


## To End your lab...

	When you have completed your lab, click End Lab. Qwiklabs removes the resources youâ€™ve used and cleans the account for you.
